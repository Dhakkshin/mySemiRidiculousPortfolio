# mySemiRidiculousPortfolio
A long-term project to build my portfolio website that reflects my journey starting right from my very first computer science class in school.

This is a very personal project for me so I'll be taking it slow with the development of this portfolio. 
If you've come to take a look at my progress, I suggest you check back a few months later. Cheers!
